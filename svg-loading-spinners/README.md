# SVG Loading Spinners

One of the best ways to learn to implement simple, static animations in Canvas Apps - learn SVG! 
SVG is a robust format that allows you to perform vector graphic animations that are compliant with any web-based technology, including Canvas Apps. The simplest way to get started? Start experimenting with loading spinners!
SVG lets you transform objects by moving, rotating, changing opacity, and much more. To best understand it, review some examples, go through some tutorials (highly recommending [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_animation.asp)), and maybe try experimenting with LLMs!
